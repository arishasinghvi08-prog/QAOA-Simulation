# QAOA-Simulation
Demonstrated the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using an Olympiad-style problem: seating ambassadors around a round table so no enemies sit together. Visualized how probabilities evolve over layers, gradually boosting optimal arrangements and suppressing unfavorable ones in an intuitive animated simulation.
